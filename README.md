Introduction üéØ

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is an intelligent software application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver's attentiveness and alertness while driving. It employs computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect signs of drowsiness or fatigue in real time and raises alarms or alerts to prevent potential accidents.

Drowsy driving is a serious issue that leads to numerous accidents worldwide. This system aims to address this problem by constantly analyzing the driver's behavior and detecting signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, yawning, or head nodding. Once detected, it can prompt the driver to take a break or notify relevant authorities to intervene.
